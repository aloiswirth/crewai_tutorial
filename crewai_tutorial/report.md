This trend not only reinforces a sense of cultural identity but also caters to consumers' desires for authentic, locally-inspired goods.

## 8. Technological Advancements in Freshness and Flavor Maintenance

Technological advancements have played a pivotal role in maintaining the freshness and flavor of bread.
